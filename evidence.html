  <h1>Clinical Evidence &amp; Validation</h1>
  <p>
    Our validation program includes analytical and clinical studies aligned to CLIA LDT practices.
    As data lock occurs, we will publish sensitivity/specificity, PPV/NPV, calibration, and
    density‑stratified performance.
  </p>

  <h2>Why complementary screening is needed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>False‑negatives in screening mammography are real (≈1 in 8 overall).</li>
    <li>False‑negative rates have risen across large U.S. datasets in the last decade.</li>
    <li>Detection yield per 1,000 screens is modest; interval cancers are higher in dense breasts.</li>
    <li>False‑positives accumulate (≥1 over 10 years for ~50–60% of screened women).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The challenge in younger women</h2>
  <p>Mammography limitations are amplified in younger women due to higher breast density:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dense breasts are the norm under 50.</strong>
      Roughly 50–74% of women aged 40–49 have heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts (BI‑RADS C or D),
      compared with 20–36% of women in their 70s (JNCI / PMC 4200066).</li>

    <li><strong>Sensitivity drops with density.</strong>
      Mammography sensitivity falls from ≈86% in fatty breasts to ≈61% in extremely dense breasts
      (BCSC benchmarks, PMC 5375631). In women under 40, first‑screening sensitivity is ≈77%
      (PMC 2902813).</li>

    <li><strong>Cancers are masked.</strong>
      Among women younger than 56, half of interval cancers (found within 12 months of a negative screen)
      were attributable to dense tissue masking (NEJM 2007; 356:227‑36).</li>

    <li><strong>Lower detection yield.</strong>
      Cancer detection per 1,000 screens is ≈1.7 in women under 40 and ≈2.3 at ages 40–44,
      versus 5.1 overall (BCSC / PMC 2902813).</li>

    <li><strong>Higher false‑positive burden.</strong>
      Women who begin screening at age 40 face roughly 50% cumulative false‑positive probability
      over 10 years, often leading to additional imaging and biopsies (NCI / USPSTF 2024).</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small">
    These publicly available statistics underscore why complementary blood‑based methods may be
    especially valuable for younger, dense‑breasted populations.
