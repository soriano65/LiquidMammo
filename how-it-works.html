  <h1>How LiquidMammo Works</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Order</strong> — A clinician orders LiquidMammo during routine care.</li>
    <li><strong>Blood Draw</strong> — Standard venipuncture; no compression or ionizing radiation.</li>
    <li><strong>microRNA Panel</strong> — Plasma is assayed for a proprietary microRNA signature associated with breast cancer biology.</li>
    <li><strong>AI‑assisted Analysis</strong> — Model estimates probability of malignancy and provides signature insights (“tipification”) to help guide next steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Clinician Report</strong> — Clear summary to complement clinical judgment and imaging; biopsy/imaging remain confirmatory.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Why an adjunct test?</h2>
  <p>
    Screening mammograms can miss cancers (false‑negatives) and the risk is higher in dense breasts.
    Large U.S. datasets suggest false‑negative rates have increased over time, underscoring the need for complementary approaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is especially relevant for younger women: roughly 50–74% of women aged 40–49 have dense breasts, and mammography sensitivity in extremely dense tissue falls to about 61%.
    Among women under 56, half of interval cancers are attributed to density‑related masking (NEJM 2007).
