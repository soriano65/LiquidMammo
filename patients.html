  <h1>A kinder, simpler way to screen—alongside your doctor</h1>
  <p>No compression. No radiation. LiquidMammo is a routine blood draw ordered by your clinician to complement imaging pathways.</p>

  <h2>Why this matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>False‑negative mammograms occur and are more likely in dense breasts.</li>
    <li>False‑positive callbacks are common over years of screening.</li>
    <li>Dense breasts are associated with higher interval cancers (found between screenings).</li>
    <li>Most women under 50 have dense breasts—about 50–74% of women in their 40s—which can lower mammography accuracy and increase the chance of a missed cancer (CDC; BCSC).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frequently asked</h2>
  <p><strong>Does this replace mammograms?</strong> No. LiquidMammo is designed to complement, not replace, imaging and clinical judgment.</p>
  <p><strong>Is it available today?</strong> We’re advancing validation for CLIA LDT availability. Your clinician will advise when and how to use it appropriately.</p>
