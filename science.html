  <h1>The Science Behind LiquidMammo</h1>

  <!-- microRNA Biology -->
  <section class="section-tight">
    <h2>microRNA &amp; tumor biology</h2>
    <p>
      microRNAs are short, non‑coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression across pathways involved in tumor initiation,
      proliferation, immune evasion, and progression. Because molecular alterations can occur before structural changes become
      visible on imaging, microRNAs provide an opportunity for earlier, biology‑based detection.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why Mammography Needs Complementation -->
  <section class="section-tight">
    <h2>Why complement mammography?</h2>
    <p>
      Mammography remains the population‑level screening standard, but like all imaging modalities, it has important limitations:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li>False‑negatives, especially in dense breasts where tissue masking reduces visibility.</li>
      <li>False‑positives accumulate over time, often leading to additional imaging and biopsies.</li>
      <li>Detection yield per 1,000 screens is modest, especially in younger age groups.</li>
      <li>Performance varies by breast density, age, equipment, and radiologist experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A molecular signal—stable, quantifiable, and not dependent on tissue density—can strengthen clinical decision‑making.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Dense Breast Limitations -->
  <section class="panel-light section-tight">
    <h2>Clinical reality in dense breasts</h2>
    <p>
      Dense tissue appears bright on mammography, as do many tumors—reducing contrast and masking malignancies.
      Interval cancers (diagnosed between routine screening exams) are more common in dense‑breasted populations.
      Adjunct approaches such as microRNA profiling may help address these diagnostic gaps.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Validation -->
  <section class="section-tight">
    <h2>Ongoing validation</h2>
    <p>
      LiquidMammo’s analytical and clinical validation follows standard CLIA Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) practices.
      As studies reach data‑lock, we will report performance across sensitivity, specificity, PPV/NPV, calibration,
      and density‑stratified subgroups. LiquidMammo is not yet FDA‑cleared or FDA‑approved.
